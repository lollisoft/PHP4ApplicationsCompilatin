# PHP4ApplicationsCompilatin
This is the new location of my PHP4Application code generator.

The compilation will contain not only the XSLT template that is responsible to generate P4A based code, but also an installer per platform to enable quick setup and getting started.

Developers are welcome to help me improving the template or giving feedback.

Currently the license will be LGPL as of my main project using such a template has the same license.
